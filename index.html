    This grid show cases my very few drawing done so far.
  </div>
  <div class="col-6">
    <h4>A broken girl</h4>
    <p><img id="image" src="images/broken_girl.png" alt="Image" /></p>

  <div class="col-7">
    <p>This drawing holds a meaningful message for me. 
      We lose trust in ourselves and feel the universe is plotting against one another even when we are devastated. 
      We begin to discover flaws in ourselves and lose sight of how valuable we all are.</br></br>
      Even when we are unable to recognise our own grandeur, others can. 
      Everyone has an aura about them that reminds individuals that the best is yet to come. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-8">
    <h4>The Lovely Swan swimming in the pond</h4>
    <p><img id="image" src="images/swan.png" alt="Image" /></p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-9">
    <p>I discovered this drawing while I browsing Pinterest. 
      Swans symbolise elegance, beauty, love, trust, and loyalty. 
      Swans are also associated with inner beauty and self-love.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-10">
    <h4>Fishes in the Pond</h4>
    <p><img id="image" src="images/fishes.png" alt="Image" /></p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-11">
    <p>The higher-self, sentiments, and impulses are represented by fish. 
      It's also a metaphor for higher levels of consciousness, as well as intelligence and cognition.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-12">
    <p>Drawing is important for our cognitive growth. It can assist us in learning to write and think creatively, 
    as well as developing hand-eye coordination, sharpening analytic abilities, and conceptualising concepts. </br></br>
    Drawing is something that calms me down after a stressfull day. 
    Whenever I need to zone out of the world, I will grab my sketch pad and start drawing. I do not have any type. Whatever I like, I draw.</p>
