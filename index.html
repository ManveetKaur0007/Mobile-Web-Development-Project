    <h2>Description</h2><br/>
    <p>This picture was taken by me while was walking with my friend
      near the city of Brampton, Ontario. The name of the river is Humber River. <br/><br/>

      In life, fighting against the current means we reject what we are 
      being presented right here, right now. Like the flow of a river, 
      life is constantly changing. Sometimes a river’s currents are loud 
      and scary. While other times they are quiet and peaceful. <br/><br/>

      The pictures can be seen when you vist the navigation bar.
